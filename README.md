# CS-210 Grocery Tracker Project

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project is a C++ grocery tracking program that reads item data from a file and tracks how often each item appears. It allows the user to search for an item, display all item counts, and generate a simple histogram. The problem it solves is organizing and summarizing raw grocery data in a usable way.

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did well separating the program into multiple files using a class. This helped keep the main logic clean and made the code easier to follow.

## Where could you enhance your code?
The code could be improved by adding stronger input validation and better error handling. These changes would make the program more reliable and prevent issues if unexpected input or files are used.

## Which pieces of the code were most challenging, and how did you overcome this?
The most challenging part was reading from the file and managing the data correctly. I overcame this by testing the program step by step and using course resources, and debugging output to verify results.

## What skills from this project are transferable?
C++ programming, object-oriented design, file input/output, and program organization. All these skills will transfer directly to future programming courses and larger projects.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using clear function and variable names and separating the code into header and source files. This structure makes the program easier to read, update, and expand in the future.
